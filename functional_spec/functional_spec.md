### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Overview

// MAYBE CHANGE SO BLOCKCHAIN IS SAID LATER IN THE OVERVIEW //

An application to replace the middle-man from online freelance/contract work services by moving transactions onto the blockchain, providing a public, immutable ledger of past transactions to show a complete and unconcealable history of each party involved. It also gives small business and startups an alternative to hiring freelance workers, with an option to trade work with other small businesses and startups.

At the moment, the freelance and contractor workspace online is primarily dominated by private companies who host job postings and more importantly, they control the reviews of the users of their site. How do we know that the reviews shown by these companies are unaltered and that they are not cherry-picking the reviews they choose to show for certain users? (e.g. An employer threatens to move to an alternate service if a negative review isn’t removed, in an attempt to cover up their wrongdoing). Placing these transactions on a blockchain will provide a more open and honest marketplace for freelance job openings.

A unique aspect of this project would be the possibility for two parties to trade work/services with each other, which could benefit small businesses who are struggling with funding the services that they outsource. For example two small business owners, one specialising in Accounting and the other in building business plans, could swap book balancing in exchange for an analysis of the others business plan. In this case similarly, the blockchain would act as a public record of past exchanges, with reviews of the quality of work etc...


#### 1.2 Business Context

// SUBJECT TO CHANGE //

The Open Freelance Hub could be deployed in competition to some of the private online freelance organisations. This system would appeal to users of these sites, both employers and employees, as it would provide them with a more open and transparent marketplace to work in. With the storage of transaction info and reviews in a public ledger more power would be provided to the users of the site as they do not have to worry about the actions of a trusted 3rd party, altering reviews or removing jobs postings. Small businesses and startups would also be attracted to this marketplace as it would allow them to trade in work/services as opposed to paying for work with the Ether cryptocurrency.
